GARMIN PROVIDES THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY SOLELY ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND ON THE CONDITION THAT LICENSEE ACCEPTS AND COMPLIES WITH THEM. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT: (A) YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT; AND (B), IF LICENSEE IS A CORPORATION, GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION, OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, POWER, AND AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE AND BIND LICENSEE TO ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, GARMIN WILL NOT AND DOES NOT LICENSE THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY TO YOU, AND YOU MUST NOT USE THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY AND MUST DELETE ALL COPIES OF THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY.

1. Grant and Scope.
Subject to and conditioned upon Licensee’s strict compliance with all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Garmin hereby grants to Licensee and its Authorized Users a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited license during the Term to use the Licensed Technology, solely as set forth in this Section 1 and subject to all conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement. This license grants Licensee and its Authorized Users the right to:

a. Use the FIT SDK;
b. Access the FIT Source Code Files; and
c. Use the FIT Protocol in any software created by Licensee as long as the interoperability and compatibility with the FIT Protocol is maintained;
in each case, solely for Licensee’s internal business purposes. These items are available free of charge for use by the Licensee on the terms and conditions set forth herein, provided that the Licensee complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Garmin reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this Agreement.

2. Use Restrictions.
Licensee shall not, and shall require its Authorized Users not to, directly or indirectly:

a. copy the Licensed Technology, in whole or in part;
b. use the Licensed Technology beyond the scope of the license granted under Section 1 of this Agreement;
c. distribute, transfer or otherwise provide the Licensed Technology to any person or entity other than its Authorized Users;
d. except as set forth herein (including Section 3), modify, translate, adapt or otherwise create derivative works or improvements, whether or not patentable, of the Licensed Technology or any part thereof;
e. remove, delete, efface, alter, obscure, translate, combine, supplement or otherwise change any trademarks, terms of the Licensed Technology’s documentation, warranties, disclaimers or intellectual property rights, proprietary rights or other symbols, notices, marks or serial numbers on or relating to the Licensed Technology;
f. use the Licensed Technology in any manner or for any purpose that infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity;
g. except as set forth herein, rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer or otherwise make available the Licensed Technology, or any features or functionality of the Licensed Technology, to any third party for any reason;
h. use the Licensed Technology in violation of any law, regulation or rule;
i. use the Licensed Technology for purposes of competitive analysis of the Licensed Technology;
j. use the Licensed Technology in or in connection with the design, construction, maintenance, operation, or use of any hazardous environments, systems or applications, any safety response systems or other safety-critical applications or any other use or application in which the use or failure of the Licensed Technology could lead to personal injury or physical or property damage; or
k. fail to comply with all definitions and provisions in the FIT Protocol or deviate from the standards as defined in the FIT Protocol and related documentation.
3. Interoperability and Compatibility. Licensee agrees to maintain the features within the Licensed Technology that provide for interoperability between systems and compatibility with previous and future release versions of the FIT Protocol. Any modifications or extensions made to the FIT Source Code Files provided in the FIT SDK are permissible only if the interoperability of the FIT Protocol is maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with the prior written consent of Garmin, which consent may be granted or denied in Garmin’s sole discretion, Licensee may modify or extend the FIT Source Code Files such that the interoperability of the FIT Protocol is not maintained.
4. Confidentiality.
In connection with this Agreement, Garmin may disclose or make available Confidential Information to Licensee. “Confidential Information” means information in any form or medium (whether oral, written, electronic or other) that: (a) if disclosed in writing or other tangible form or medium, is marked “confidential” or “proprietary”; or (b) if disclosed orally or in another intangible form or medium, is identified by Garmin as confidential or proprietary when disclosed and later summarized and marked “confidential” or “proprietary” in writing by Garmin. Without limiting the foregoing, the Licensed Technology is Confidential Information of Garmin.

Confidential Information does not include information that Licensee can demonstrate by written or other documentary records: (1) was rightfully known to Licensee without restriction on use or disclosure prior to such information being disclosed or made available to Licensee in connection with this Agreement; (2) was or becomes generally known by the public other than by Licensee’s noncompliance with this Agreement; (3) was or is received by Licensee on a non-confidential basis from a third party that was not or is not under any obligation to maintain its confidentiality; or (4) was independently developed by Licensee without reference to or use of any Confidential Information.

Licensee shall: (A) not access or use Confidential Information other than as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under and in accordance with this Agreement; (B) safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure using at least the degree of care it uses to protect its sensitive information and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care; and (C) promptly notify Garmin of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information and take all reasonable steps to prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure. If Licensee is compelled by applicable law to disclose any Confidential Information then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Licensee will: (i) promptly, and prior to such disclosure, notify Garmin in writing of such requirement so that Garmin can, at Garmin’s option, seek a protective order or other remedy or waive its rights under this paragraph; and (ii), at Garmin’s expense, provide reasonable assistance to Garmin in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure. Subject to the preceding sentence, Licensee will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that, on the advice of legal counsel, Licensee is legally required to disclose and, on Garmin’s request, will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from the applicable court or other presiding authority that such Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.

5. Intellectual Property Rights.
Licensee acknowledges and agrees:

a. that the Licensed Technology is licensed, not sold, to Licensee by Garmin and Licensee does not have under or in connection with this Agreement any ownership interest in the Licensed Technology, or in any related intellectual property rights;
b. not to claim any intellectual ownership of or rights in or to the Licensed Technology, or any associated documentation, and that these remain the exclusive property of Garmin;
c. to safeguard the Licensed Technology from infringement, misappropriation, theft, misuse or unauthorized access;

f. at Garmin’s expense, to reasonably cooperate with and assist Garmin in all reasonable ways to prevent or abate any actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of Garmin’s rights in, and to attempt to resolve any actions or proceedings relating to, the Licensed Technology;
g. that Licensee hereby unconditionally and irrevocably assigns to Garmin or its designee, on behalf of itself and its Authorized Users, Licensee’s and its Authorized Users’ entire right, title, and interest in and to any intellectual property rights that Licensee or its Authorized Users may now or hereafter have in or relating to the Licensed Technology (including any rights in derivative works or patent improvements, as well as suggestions or recommended changes to or feedback regarding the Licensed Technology), whether held or acquired by operation of law, contract, assignment or otherwise;
h. that any information and ideas it places in the Licensed Technology will be accessible to and may be freely used by all licensees of the Licensed Technology, and that Licensee will not threaten to or actually bring litigation against any other licensee of the Licensed Technology related to that licensee’s use or disclosure of any information or ideas Licensee places in the Licensed Technology; and
i. except for the limited rights and license expressly granted under this Agreement, that nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel or otherwise, to Licensee or any third party any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to any of the Licensed Technology.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF GARMIN TO LICENSEE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EXCEED $100. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

9. Term and Termination.
The term of this Agreement commences as of Licensee’s acceptance of this Agreement or first use of any Licensed Technology, whichever occurs earlier, and continues in effect until terminated as provided herein (the “Term”).

If Licensee breaches any of the terms of this Agreement, Garmin may immediately terminate this Agreement. In addition, Garmin or Licensee may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon delivery of 30 days’ written notice to the other party.

Upon any such termination, (a) all rights of Licensee under this Agreement (including the license granted hereunder) shall cease, (b) Licensee must immediately stop use of (including product development of devices relating to) the Licensed Technology and (c) Licensee shall delete all copies of the Licensed Technology and any Confidential Information; provided, however, Licensee shall not be required to delete electronic copies of Confidential Information generated automatically by archival or data backup systems, so long as such copies are not accessed or used in any manner that violates the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

11. Miscellaneous.
a. Further Assurances. Upon Garmin’s reasonable request, Licensee shall execute and deliver all such documents and instruments, and take all such further actions, as may be necessary to give full effect to this Agreement.
b. Relationship of the Parties. The relationship between Garmin and Licensee is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties, and neither party shall have authority to contract for or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.
c. Notices. Any notice, request, consent, claim, demand, waiver or other communication under this Agreement will only have legal effect if in writing. Licensee must send all such notices or other communications in writing to Garmin at the following address: 1200 East 151st Street, Olathe, Kansas 66062, Attention: Legal Department.

d. Severability. Licensee agrees that if any part of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain in effect for the Licensee and for Garmin. On such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, Garmin and Licensee shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
e. Governing Law and Forum Selection. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Kansas, without regard to any conflicts of laws principles.

g. Assignment. Licensee shall not assign this Agreement, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law, by merger or otherwise, without Garmin’s prior written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be delayed or withheld. For purposes of this Agreement, a change of control will be deemed an assignment. No assignment, delegation or transfer will relieve Licensee of any of its obligations or performance under this Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of this Section is void. This Agreement is binding on and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
h. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended from time to time by Garmin in its sole discretion. Licensee is responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such amendment.

Any other attempt to alter or amend these terms and conditions will be null and void, unless otherwise agreed to in a written agreement signed by both Licensee and Garmin.
i. Force Majeure. In no event will Garmin be liable or responsible to Licensee, or be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any term of this Agreement when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond Garmin’s reasonable control, including acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake or explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, embargoes or blockades, national or regional emergency, epidemics, pandemics, diseases, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, passage or change of law or any other action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an export or import restriction, quota, quarantine restrictions or other restriction or prohibition or any complete or partial government shutdown.

k. Waiver. No waiver by either party of any of the provisions hereof is effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
l. Equitable Relief. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by Licensee of any of its obligations under this Agreement would cause Garmin irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, Garmin will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court of competent jurisdiction, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.
